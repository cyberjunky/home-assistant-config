# Home Assistant Configuration

This repository holds the configuration of my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) setup. After a long time experimenting and looking at other peoples [users configs](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&s=stars&type=Repositories) and browsing through the [forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/latest) I think I have figured out the layout I'm most comfortable with.

I will also use this repository to create issues holding ideas and items to fix, now they are scattered over paper notes, text files and Google Keep, it's a chaos.

I just started to set this up and will be expanded over the coming period.
Please :star2: my repository if you like it and want see the progress and the experiments.

Also have a look at my [Custom Components](https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-custom-components)

## Generic Setup

**Server**

My setup is running on Ubuntu 18.04.1 (bionic) inside Docker on a i5 CPU powered mainboard with passive cooling, so no noise.
Nowadays I would buy a Intel NUC I guess, but the hardware was there and is performing well.

I'm using the HASS.io image, simply because it's easy to maintain and I can focus on all the other stuff.

I will include the basic steps to get all above installed soon.

## Hardware Used
