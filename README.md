# Home Assistant Setup

This repository holds the setup (hardware) and configuration of my Home Automation using [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/). After a long time experimenting and looking at other peoples [users configs](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&s=stars&type=Repositories) and browsing through the [forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/latest) I think I have figured out the layout I'm most comfortable with.

I will also use this repository to create issues holding ideas and items to fix, now they are scattered over paper notes, text files and Google Keep, it's a chaos.

I just started to set this up and will be expanded over the coming period.
Please :star2: my repository if you like it and want see the progress and the experiments.

Also have a look at my [Custom Components](https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-custom-components)

## Generic Setup

**Server**

My setup is running on a custom build server using passive cooling running Ubuntu 18.04.1 (bionic) 64 bits.
Nowadays I would buy a Intel NUC I guess, but the hardware was there already and is performing well.

You can find detailed build instructions [here](https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-config/blob/master/docs/server/INSTALL.md).

**Home Assistant**

I'm using the Hass.io image running inside docker, simply because it's easy to maintain so I can focus on all the other stuff.

*I will include more instructions to get all installed and running soon*
